            <h1>Team Breakdown</h1>
            <p>Each subteam within Cornell Cup has a team lead. The three main subteams this year are the R2-D2, Minibot, and Modbot projects. But, as always, we are looking to expand and grow our Cornell Cup family to make us perform as efficiently as possible. As such, this year we added a Business team and a small Web Development team.</p>
