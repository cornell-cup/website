                <p>Over the years Cornell Cup Robotics has successfully create numerous projects. These projects range from a humanoid robot that is able to play RockBand with 98% accuracy, to an autonomous omni-directional rover named DuneBot, and even functional droids inspired by R2D2 and C3PO. Many of the projects make use of the modular robotics platform ModBot. The team supported the Intel-Cornell Cup, an internationally renowned embedded systems competition, and is now beginning to host the ARM-Cornell Cup.</p>
